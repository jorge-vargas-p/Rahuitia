          The aim of Te Kaupapa Rahuitia is also to make available an API (Application programming interface) that provides data to other web applications in a useful format so that this information could be used responsibly when it is needed and appropriate. We imagine a world where mapping services could communicate important and urgent information such as the details relating to a rahui to an end user. If we think about apps that send push notifications when a user is in proximity to a particular location, usually to encourage a review or feedback about a product or experience, we have been imagining how rich it would be to promote the tikanga of rahui so that a user can be more conscious and informed about their surroundings and how they situate themselves in a landscape. </p>
